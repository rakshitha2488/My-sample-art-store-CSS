Project 3: art Store 
difficuLty LEvEL: Advanced

Overview

This project builds on the art store example from the previous chapter (Project 2.3), but purposefully 
leaves you having to dig a little deeper into CSS.

Instructions

1. Create a new file named chapter03-project03.html and remove all default styles via a reset.css stylesheet, 
   as done for the previous two projects.
   
2. Modify chapter03-project03.html and an associated style sheet so that your output looks similar to 
   that shown in Figure 3.31. Do not modify the markup within the <body> element.
   
3. You will have to use a CSS3 feature that will require some research on your own. 
   The background-size property can be used to force a background image to resize to the browser window.
   
4. Notice that two of the blocks in Figure 3.33 are partially transparent. Remember that CSS3 allows you 
   to specify the alpha transparency of any color.
   
5. Finally, the header uses the font Six Caps, which will have to be supplemented with other options in 
   the font stack in the event that font is not present on the clientâ€™s computer.
   
Testing

1. First, try resizing your browser to ensure the image resizes dynamically to fill the space, and the 
   floating objects position themselves correctly.
   
2. Try out different browsers or platforms to see if it really works on all types of devices, including 
   your mobile phone.
   
Hint: This is tricky if you have not yet set up a web server. You may have to return to finish this particular 
testing step until after you have access to a web server as described in Chapter 8.
